## Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Cross-Consistency Training (CCT)

#### [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09005), [Project Page](https://yassouali.github.io/cct_page/)

This repo contains the official implementation of CVPR 2020 paper: Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with
Cross-Consistecy Training, which
adapts the traditional consistency training framework of semi-supervised learning for semantic segmentation, with an
extension to weak-supervised
learning and learning on multiple domains.

### Highlights

**(1) Consistency Training for semantic segmentation.** \
We observe that for semantic segmentation, due to the dense nature of the task,
the cluster assumption is more easily enforced over the hidden representations rather than the inputs.

**(2) Cross-Consistecy Training.** \
We propose CCT (Cross-Consistecy Training) for semi-supervised semantic segmentation, where we define
a number of novel perturbations, and show the effectiveness of enforcing consistency over the encoder's outputs
rather than the inputs.

**(3) Using weak-labels and pixel-level labels from multiple domains.** \
The proposed method is quite simple and flexible, and can easily be extended to use image-level labels and
pixel-level labels from multiple-domains.

### Requirements

This repo was tested with Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS, Python 3.7, PyTorch 1.1.0, and CUDA 10.0. But it should be runnable with
recent PyTorch versions >=1.1.0.

The required packages are `pytorch` and `torchvision`, together with `PIL` and `opencv` for data-preprocessing
and `tqdm` for showing the training progress.
With some additional modules like `dominate` to save the results in the form of HTML files. To setup the necessary
modules, simply run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset

In this repo, we use **Pascal VOC**, to obtain it, first download
the [original dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/VOCtrainval_11-May-2012.tar), after extracting the
files we'll end up with `VOCtrainval_11-May-2012/VOCdevkit/VOC2012` containing the image sets, the XML annotation for
both object detection and segmentation, and JPEG images.\
The second step is to augment the dataset using the additionnal annotations provided
by [Semantic Contours from Inverse Detectors](http://home.bharathh.info/pubs/pdfs/BharathICCV2011.pdf). Download the
rest of the annotations [SegmentationClassAug](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oeu149j8qtbs1x0/SegmentationClassAug.zip?dl=0)
and add them to the path `VOCtrainval_11-May-2012/VOCdevkit/VOC2012`, now we're set, for training use the path
to `VOCtrainval_11-May-2012`.

### Training

To train a model, first download PASCAL VOC as detailed above, then set `data_dir` to the dataset path in the config
file in `configs/config.json` and set the rest of the parameters, like the number of GPUs, cope size, data augmentation
... etc ,you can also change CCT hyperparameters if you wish, more details below. Then simply run:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/config.json
```

The log files and the `.pth` checkpoints will be saved in `saved\EXP_NAME`, to monitor the training using tensorboard,
please run:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir saved
```

To resume training using a saved `.pth` model:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/config.json --resume saved/CCT/checkpoint.pth
```

**Results**: The results will be saved in `saved` as an html file, containing the validation results,
and the name it will take is `experim_name` specified in `configs/config.json`.

### Pseudo-labels

If you want to use image level labels to train the auxiliary labels as explained in section 3.3 of the paper. First
generate the pseudo-labels
using the code in `pseudo_labels`:

```bash
cd pseudo_labels
python run.py --voc12_root DATA_PATH
```

`DATA_PATH` must point to the folder containing `JPEGImages` in Pascal Voc dataset. The results will be
saved in `pseudo_labels/result/pseudo_labels` as PNG files, the flag `use_weak_labels` needs to be set to True in the
config file, and
then we can train the model as detailed above.

### Inference

For inference, we need a pretrained model, the jpg images we'd like to segment and the config used in training (to load
the correct model and other parameters),

```bash
python inference.py --config config.json --model best_model.pth --images images_folder
```

The predictions will be saved as `.png` images in `outputs\` is used, for Pacal VOC the default palette is:

Here are the flags available for inference:

```
--images       Folder containing the jpg images to segment.
--model        Path to the trained pth model.
--config       The config file used for training the model.
```
